However, the required generated brand assets are only referenced, not shown as added under the required public path, and unrequested authentication/Internet Identity hooks were added (conflicting with the non-goal of user accounts/auth).",

      "reason": "The UI references the asset URLs, but the diff summary does not show the required generated image files being added under frontend/public/assets/generated (and two added files were omitted due to limits, so existence cannot be confirmed from provided evidence).",
